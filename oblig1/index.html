 Put an HTML file (e.g., index.html) in the same directory that the server is in. Run the server program.
Open a browser and provide the corresponding URL. For example: http://127.0.0.1:6789/index.html
‘index.html’ is the name of the file you placed in the server directory. Note also the use of the port
number after the colon. You need to replace this port number with whatever port you have used in
the server code. In the above example, we have used the port number 6789. The browser should then
display the contents of index.html. If you omit ”:6789”, the browser will assume port 80 and you will
get the web page from the server only if your server is listening at port 80. Then try to get a file that
is not present at the server. You should get a “404 Not Found” message.
